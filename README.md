An autonomous sports training framework powered by deep reinforcement learning for behavior planning, real-time decision-making, and performance optimization.

## Overview

Traditional sports analytics rely heavily on statistical modeling and historical data, which are often insufficient for capturing the complex, real-time dynamics of modern athletic environments. This project introduces a novel framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enable intelligent behavior planning and strategic adaptation in autonomous sports training systems.

Our framework consists of two key components:

- **GAPP-Net (Game-Aware Performance Prediction Network)**: A deep learning model that analyzes player-level statistics, team interactions, and temporal dynamics.
- **Multi-Agent DRL Engine**: An adaptive learning module that simulates competitive scenarios and optimizes player training and behavior strategies in real-time.

## Key Features

- Deep reinforcement learning for autonomous behavior planning
- Multi-agent training to model real-world team interactions
- Game-aware performance prediction using sequential data
- Real-time adaptability to tactical changes and player variation
- Interpretability through feature attribution techniques

## Architecture

### GAPP-Net
- Inputs: Player metrics, team dynamics, event sequences
- Outputs: Performance predictions, behavior scores
- Uses attention mechanisms and recurrent layers to handle temporal data

### Multi-Agent DRL Module
- Simulates multiple players or roles in dynamic training environments
- Learns optimal behavior policies through environment interaction
- Adjusts strategy based on game context and player development
